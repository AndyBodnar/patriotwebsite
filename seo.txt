# 3. WHAT YOUR SITE IS MISSING (CRITICAL SEO PROBLEMS)

## ❌ 1. Missing Keyword-Focused Meta Titles
Your site doesn't target exact search phrases:

- "Dumpster rental Phoenix"
- "Roll-off dumpsters Phoenix AZ"
- "Waste disposal services Phoenix"
- "Construction dumpster rental Phoenix"

**Fix:** Every page needs a unique, keyword-rich title under 60 characters.

---

## ❌ 2. Missing Local (Geo) Optimization
Current content doesn't emphasize service areas:

- Phoenix
- Tempe
- Mesa
- Chandler
- Gilbert
- Scottsdale
- Glendale
- Peoria

**Fix:** Mention cities naturally in content. Create city-specific landing pages.

---

## ❌ 3. Insufficient Keyword Density
Current copy uses "Patriot Disposal" but not **searched** phrases:

- dumpster rental
- waste disposal
- roll-off dumpsters
- debris removal
- junk hauling

**Fix:** Replace brand-focused copy with search-intent copy. Aim for 1-2% keyword density.

---

## ❌ 4. No Dedicated Service Pages
Each service needs its own URL:

- /services/dumpster-rental
- /services/construction-dumpsters
- /services/residential-waste
- /services/commercial-waste
- /services/recycling

**Fix:** Create individual pages. Google ranks pages, not sections.

---

## ❌ 5. Schema Markup Missing
LocalBusiness schema tells Google:

- Business name, address, phone
- Operating hours
- Service area
- Geo coordinates
- Price range

**Fix:** Add JSON-LD schema to layout.tsx head.

---

## ❌ 6. Weak Backlink/Citation Profile
You need listings on:

- Google Business Profile (CRITICAL)
- Yelp
- Bing Places
- Apple Maps
- Thumbtack
- Angi (formerly Angie's List)
- HomeAdvisor
- BBB
- Local Phoenix directories
- Arizona Republic business listings

**Fix:** Create consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms.

---

## ❌ 7. Missing City Landing Pages
HUGE for local businesses. You need:

- /areas/phoenix
- /areas/tempe
- /areas/mesa
- /areas/chandler
- /areas/gilbert
- /areas/scottsdale
- /areas/glendale
- /areas/peoria
- /areas/surprise
- /areas/goodyear

**Fix:** Each page targets "[service] + [city]" keywords with unique content.

---

## ❌ 8. No Internal Linking Strategy
Pages don't connect to each other. Google uses internal links to:

- Discover pages
- Understand page hierarchy
- Pass authority between pages

**Fix:** Every page should link to 3-5 related pages.

---

## ❌ 9. Missing Image Optimization
Current issues:

- No alt tags on images
- Images not compressed
- No WebP format
- No lazy loading attributes

**Fix:** Compress all images, add descriptive alt tags, use Next.js Image component.

---

## ❌ 10. No Structured FAQ Content
FAQ sections:

- Target long-tail keywords
- Can appear in Google's "People Also Ask"
- Build topical authority

**Fix:** Add FAQ section to homepage and service pages.

---

## ❌ 11. Missing Open Graph & Twitter Cards
Social sharing looks broken without:

- og:title
- og:description
- og:image
- twitter:card

**Fix:** Add to layout.tsx metadata.

---

## ❌ 12. No XML Sitemap
Google needs a sitemap to discover all pages efficiently.

**Fix:** Next.js can auto-generate. Add sitemap.ts to app folder.

---

## ❌ 13. No robots.txt
Tells search engines what to crawl.

**Fix:** Add robots.txt to public folder.

---

# 4. TECHNICAL SEO CHECKLIST

## Core Web Vitals Targets

[ ] Use Next.js Image component with priority on above-fold images
[ ] Lazy load below-fold images
[ ] Minimize JavaScript bundle size
